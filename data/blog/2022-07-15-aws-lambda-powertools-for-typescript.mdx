If you're like me, you are always trying to find ways to make life easier. I am constantly automating things around the house or trying new tips and tricks to
improve my daily life. The same can be said about building software. AWS Lambda makes it incredibly easy to run code without thinking about servers,
allowing developers to focus on what they do best - code. Developers love building serverless applications with AWS Lambda because it offers greater scalability,
quicker time to release, and more flexibility, all at reduced costs.

However, AWS Lambda and serverless applications are not without flaws and introduce new challenges and complexity. Challenges such as debugging, tracing, and
[developing for retries and failures](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/operatorguide/retries-failures.html) must be solved differently than traditional
applications, often with custom code. These problems aren't always trivial to solve. Lambda functions can quickly become bloated with boilerplate code, muddying
up core business logic. What if there was an easy way to overcome these challenges and improve the developer experience?

## Enter AWS Lambda Powertools

AWS Lambda Powertools is an open-source library providing a collection of utilities for AWS Lambda functions designed to make developers' lives easier. The
collection of utilities focuses on implementing best practices such as structured logging, custom metrics, tracing, and more, as defined in the
[AWS Well-Architected Serverless Lens](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/serverless-applications-lens/welcome.html). Think of each utility
as a “power-up” for Lambda, adding a unique ability to help solve distinct challenges found in serverless applications. Developers can choose the utilities
they need to follow serverless best practices while avoiding creating and maintaining custom code. AWS Lambda Powertools supports the three most popular Lambda
runtimes - Python, Java, and now Node.js, with the official general availability release of
[AWS Lambda Powertools for TypeScript](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-typescript/latest/).

Don't let the name AWS Lambda Powertools for TypeScript mislead you. This library has been developed for the Lambda Node.js runtime. Therefore, it is
compatible with Lambda functions developed with either TypeScript or JavaScript! Currently, AWS Lambda Powertools for TypeScript comes with the core
Logger, Tracer, and Metrics utilities, focusing on implementing best practices outlined in the
[Operational Excellence Pillar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/serverless-applications-lens/operational-excellence-pillar.html). In addition,
the TypeScript version will receive the same features as the Python and Java versions in subsequent releases, as seen in the
[roadmap](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-powertools-typescript/projects/2).

## Show Me the Power!

Let's “power-up” a sample application using AWS Lambda Powertools for TypeScript by walking through how to use each utility. I modified the sample application
used in the [AWS TypeScript CDK Workshop](https://cdkworkshop.com/20-typescript.html) to show how easy it is to incorporate AWS Lambda Powertools into an
existing application. In addition, since the [official documentation](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-typescript/latest/) only has examples
in TypeScript, I provided a JavaScript example for those unfamiliar with TypeScript. The complete code for these examples can be found on
[Github](https://github.com/trek10inc/lambda-powertools-typescript-examples).

### Middy

Before focusing on each utility, I want to highlight [Middy](https://github.com/middyjs/middy), an open-source Node.js middleware library for AWS Lambda.
AWS Lambda Powertools for TypeScript has built-in support for Middy to reduce the manual setup required for some features. Since Middy works with TypeScript
and JavaScript, the utility instrumentation will be the same for both languages. Middy can also be used outside AWS Lambda Powertools for TypeScript to create
custom middleware for other use cases. Each example below will use the Middy implementation to set up each utility.

### Logger

The [Logger utility](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-typescript/latest/core/logger/) provides an opinionated logger to standardize the output
with operational information structured as JSON. It can also capture keys from the Lambda context and allows custom keys to be logged at any time to answer
questions about the application's state. [Centralized and structured logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/serverless-applications-lens/opex-logging.html)
is a crucial best practice in serverless applications. Centralized logging helps you search and analyze your serverless application logs.
Structured logging makes it easier to build queries to help with debugging.

**TypeScript**

```typescript
// import Logger and injectLambdaContext middleware to auto-capture and log the Lambda Context
import { Logger, injectLambdaContext } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/logger';
// import middy (required for injectLambdaContext to automatically inject the Lambda context into the logs)
import middy from '@middy/core';
// import Lambda Context Type
import { Context } from 'aws-lambda';

// create Powertools Logger instance with custom service name
const logger = new Logger();

const lambdaHandler = async (event: any, context: Context): Promise<unknown> => {
  // Old way of logging
  console.log('Incoming Request:', { event });
  // New way of logging using Powertools Logger
  logger.info('Incoming Request:', { event });

  ...
}

// Use middy to add middleware to the Lambda handler.
// It cleans up the handler and removes the need to add boilerplate code, while also allowing you to add custom middleware if needed.
export const handler = middy(lambdaHandler).use(injectLambdaContext(logger));
```

**JavaScript**

```javascript
// import Logger and injectLambdaContext middleware to auto-capture and log the Lambda Context
const { Logger, injectLambdaContext } = require('@aws-lambda-powertools/logger');
// import middy (required for injectLambdaContext to automatically inject the Lambda context into the logs)
const middy = require('@middy/core');

// create Powertools Logger instance with custom service name
const logger = new Logger();

const lambdaHandler = async function (event, context) {
  // Old way of logging
  console.log('Incoming Request:', { event });
  // New way of logging using Powertools Logger
  logger.info('Incoming Request:', { event });

  ...
}

// Use middy to add middleware to the Lambda handle
// It cleans up the handler and removes the need to add boilerplate code, while also allowing you to add custom middleware if needed.
const handler = middy(lambdaHandler).use(injectLambdaContext(logger));

module.exports = { handler };
```

Let's compare the outputs of `console.log()` and `logger.info()`.

<div className="align-center flex justify-center text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">

</div>

Using [CloudWatch Logs Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AnalyzingLogData.html),
the structured logs can be easily searched and analyzed to help debug serverless applications.

The Logger utility is a simple “power-up” that overhauls logging in Lambda functions. Debugging Lambda functions can be a challenge
due to their serverless nature. The Logger utility makes it extremely easy with little to no overhead.

### Tracer

The [Tracer utility](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-typescript/latest/core/tracer/) is an opinionated wrapper around
the AWS X-Ray SDK for Node.js, making it easy to adopt
[distributed tracing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/serverless-applications-lens/opex-distributed-tracing.html).
If you want a quick explanation of AWS X-Ray, check out [AWS Xray Xplained](https://www.trek10.com/blog/aws-xray-xplained)
on Trek10's CloudProse Blog. The Tracer utility automatically captures cold starts and service names as annotations, providing
filtering and searching by a specific service. In addition, it automatically traces HTTP(S) clients and generates subsegments for
each request. My favorite benefit of using the Tracer utility is reducing boilerplate code to create subsegments, which cleans up the
Lambda handler. I also appreciate having a Service Map of the entire application. This helps visualize the different parts of the
application and provides performance insights for faster troubleshooting. Check out the code snippets below to see how to use the Tracer utility.

:::note
**Note:** Ensure “Active Tracing” is turned on for your Lambda function when setting up the Tracer.
:::

**TypeScript**

```typescript
// import Tracer utility and middleware
import { Tracer, captureLambdaHandler } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/tracer';
// import AWS clients
import { DynamoDBClient } from '@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb';
import { DynamoDBDocumentClient } from '@aws-sdk/lib-dynamodb';
import { LambdaClient } from '@aws-sdk/client-lambda';
// import Lambda Context Type
import { Context } from 'aws-lambda';
// import middy (required for captureLambdaHandler to automatically create/close subsegments)
import middy from '@middy/core';

// create Powertools Tracer instance
const tracer = new Tracer();

// patch AWS v3 clients to automatically capture AWS service calls
const dynamoDBClient = tracer.captureAWSv3Client(new DynamoDBClient({}));
const dynamoDBDocumentClient = DynamoDBDocumentClient.from(dynamoDBClient);
const lambdaClient = tracer.captureAWSv3Client(new LambdaClient({}));

const lambdaHandler = async (event: any, context: Context): Promise<unknown> => {
  // Optionally add custom annotation for filtering traces
  tracer.putAnnotation('awsRequestId', context.awsRequestId);
  // Optionally add custom metadata for traces
  tracer.putMetadata('eventPayload', event);

  ...
}

// Use middy to add middleware to the Lambda handler.
// It cleans up the handler and removes the need to add boilerplate code, while also allowing you to add custom middleware if needed.
export const handler = middy(lambdaHandler).use(captureLambdaHandler(tracer));
```

**JavaScript**

```javascript
// import Tracer utility and middleware
const { Tracer, captureLambdaHandler } = require('@aws-lambda-powertools/tracer');
// import AWS clients
const { DynamoDB, Lambda } = require('aws-sdk');
// import middy (required for captureLambdaHandler to automatically create/close subsegments)
const middy = require('@middy/core');

// create Powertools Logger instance
const logger = new Logger();
// create Powertools Tracer instance
const tracer = new Tracer();

// patch AWS v3 clients to automatically capture AWS service calls
const dynamo = tracer.captureAWSClient(new DynamoDB());
const lambda = tracer.captureAWSClient(new Lambda());

const lambdaHandler = async function (event, context) {
  // Optionally add custom annotation for filtering traces
  tracer.putAnnotation('awsRequestId', context.awsRequestId);
  // Optionally add custom metadata for traces
  tracer.putMetadata('eventPayload', event);

  ...
}

// Use middy to add middleware to the Lambda handler.
// It cleans up the handler and removes the need to add boilerplate code, while also allowing you to add custom middleware if needed.
const handler = middy(lambdaHandler).use(captureLambdaHandler(tracer));

module.exports = { handler };
```

</div>

The Tracer utility is a great “power-up” to add distributed tracing to your Lambda functions to gain insights
into performance degradation or network anomalies. It becomes even more powerful when coupled with structured logs
from the Logger utility to improve the troubleshooting experience.

### Metrics

The [Metrics utility](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-typescript/latest/core/metrics/)
creates custom CloudWatch metrics by logging metrics to standard output following
[Amazon CloudWatch Embedded Metric Format (EMF)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Embedded_Metric_Format.html).
The metrics are then asynchronously uploaded to CloudWatch without affecting the performance of the serverless application.
Potential use cases for gathering metrics are tracking the number of orders placed or the average time it takes to check out in an online store.
The metrics can then be visualized in a dashboard in CloudWatch around these specific business goals.

**TypeScript**

```typescript
// import Metrics utility and logMetrics middleware to capture cold start metrics
import { Metrics, MetricUnits, logMetrics } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/metrics';
// import middy (required for captureColdStartMetric to automatically capture cold start metrics)
import middy from '@middy/core';
// import Lambda Context Type
import { Context } from 'aws-lambda';

// create Powertools Metrics instance
const metrics = new Metrics();

const lambdaHandler = async (event: any, context: Context): Promise<unknown> => {
  // Optionally create a custom metric
  metrics.addMetric('hit', MetricUnits.Count, 1);
  metrics.publishStoredMetrics();

  ...
}

// Use middy to add middleware to the Lambda handler
// It cleans up the handler and removes the need to add boilerplate code, while also allowing you to add custom middleware if needed.
export const handler = middy(lambdaHandler)
  .use(
    logMetrics(metrics, {
      captureColdStartMetric: true
    })
  );

```

**JavaScript**

```javascript
// import Metrics utility and middleware
const { Metrics, MetricUnits, logMetrics } = require('@aws-lambda-powertools/metrics');
// import middy (required for captureColdStartMetric to automatically capture cold start metrics)
const middy = require('@middy/core');

// create Powertools Metrics instance
const metrics = new Metrics();

const lambdaHandler = async function (event, context) {
  // Optionally create a custom metric
  metrics.addMetric('hit', MetricUnits.Count, 1);
  metrics.publishStoredMetrics();

  ...
}

// Use middy to add middleware to the Lambda handler.
// It cleans up the handler and removes the need to add boilerplate code, while also allowing you to add custom middleware if needed.
const handler = middy(lambdaHandler)
  .use(
    logMetrics(metrics, {
      captureColdStartMetric: true
    })
  );

module.exports = { handler }
```

<a

    />
  </div>
</a>

<div className="align-center flex justify-center text-sm">
  Create dashboards in the console using custom metrics from your application.
</div>

The Metrics utility is the perfect “power-up” to make it easy to adopt
[metrics best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/serverless-applications-lens/opex-metrics-and-alerts.html)
by simplifying the creation and collection of custom metrics without developing and maintaining custom logic.

## Final Thoughts

AWS fully maintains this project and has a large active community for developers to get support or request additional features.
For example, there is a [feature request](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-powertools-typescript/issues/646) for adding support
for other observability providers like New Relic and Datadog. Lambda Powertools for TypeScript currently focuses on improving
observability in serverless applications using Amazon CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray. At Trek10, we heavily use Datadog, so I'm hoping
this feature will eventually make its way into a subsequent release! I've already added the Logger and Tracer utilities to my
existing Node.js Lambda functions, significantly improving observability and making debugging easier. I love how simple
AWS Lambda Powertools makes it to adopt best practices and follow the AWS Well-Architected Framework when building serverless applications.
