## Meet Professor William Sharpe

An investment may make sense if we expect it to return more money than it costs. But returns are
only part of the story because they are risky - there may be a range of possible outcomes. How
does one compare different investments that may deliver similar results on average, but exhibit
different levels of risks?

Enter William Sharpe.

  <Image alt="sharpe" src="/static/images/sharpe-ratio/sharpe.jpeg" width={200} height={250} />
</div>

He introduced the [reward-to-variability
ratio]("https://web.stanford.edu/~wfsharpe/art/sr/sr.htm") in 1966 that soon came to be called the
Sharpe Ratio. It compares the expected returns for two investment opportunities and calculates the
additional return per unit of risk an investor could obtain by choosing one over the other. In
particular, it looks at the difference in returns for two investments and compares the average
difference to the standard deviation (as a measure of risk) of this difference. A higher Sharpe
ratio means that the reward will be higher for a given amount of risk. It is common to compare a
specific opportunity against a benchmark that represents an entire category of investments.

The Sharpe ratio has been one of the most popular risk/return measures in finance, not least
because it's so simple to use. It also helped that Professor Sharpe won a Nobel Memorial Prize in
Economics in 1990 for his work on the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).

Let's learn about the Sharpe ratio by calculating it for the stocks of the two tech giants
Facebook and Amazon. As a benchmark, we'll use the S&amp;P 500 that measures the performance of
the 500 largest stocks in the US.

```python
# Importing required modules
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Settings to produce nice plots in a Jupyter notebook
plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')
%matplotlib inline

# Reading in the data
stock_data = pd.read_csv('datasets/stock_data.csv', parse_dates=['Date'], index_col='Date').dropna()
benchmark_data = pd.read_csv('datasets/benchmark_data.csv', parse_dates=['Date'], index_col='Date').dropna()
```

## A first glance at the data

Let's take a look the data to find out how many observations and variables we have at our
disposal.

```python
# Display summary for stock_data
print('Stocks\n')
stock_data.info()
print(stock_data.head())

# Display summary for benchmark_data
print('\nBenchmarks\n')
benchmark_data.info()
print(benchmark_data.head())

```

## Plot & summarize daily prices for Amazon and Facebook

Before we compare an investment in either Facebook or Amazon with the index of the 500 largest
companies in the US, let's visualize the data, so we better understand what we're dealing with.

```python
# visualize the stock_data
stock_data.plot(subplots=True, title='Stock Data')

# summarize the stock_data
stock_data.describe()
```

</div>

## Visualize &amp; summarize daily values for the S&amp;P 500

Let's also take a closer look at the value of the S&amp;P 500, our benchmark.

```python
# plot the benchmark_data
benchmark_data.plot(title='S&P 500')

# summarize the benchmark_data
benchmark_data.describe()
```

|       | **S&amp;P 500** |

## The inputs for the Sharpe Ratio: Starting with Daily Stock Returns

The Sharpe Ratio uses the difference in returns between the two investment opportunities under
consideration.

However, our data show the historical value of each investment, not the return. To calculate the
return, we need to calculate the percentage change in value from one day to the next. We'll also
take a look at the summary statistics because these will become our inputs as we calculate the
Sharpe Ratio. Can you already guess the result?

```python
# calculate daily stock_data returns
stock_returns = stock_data.pct_change()

# plot the daily returns
stock_returns.plot()

# summarize the daily returns
stock_returns.describe()
```

|       | **Amazon** | **Facebook** |
| ----- | ---------- | ------------ |
| count | 251.000000 | 251.000000   |
| mean  | 0.000818   | 0.000626     |
| std   | 0.018383   | 0.017840     |
| min   | -0.076100  | -0.058105    |
| 25%   | -0.007211  | -0.007220    |
| 50%   | 0.000857   | 0.000879     |
| 75%   | 0.009224   | 0.008108     |
| max   | 0.095664   | 0.155214     |

<div style={{ backgroundColor: 'white' }}>

  <Image
    alt="output_9_1.png"
    src="/static/images/sharpe-ratio/output_9_1.png"
    width={640}
    height={427}
  />
</div>

## Daily S&amp;P 500 returns

For the S&amp;P 500, calculating daily returns works just the same way, we just need to make sure
we select it as a <code>Series</code> using single brackets <code>[]</code> and not as a{' '}

<code>DataFrame</code> to facilitate the calculations in the next step.

```python
# calculate daily benchmark_data returns
sp_returns = benchmark_data['S&P 500'].pct_change()

# plot the daily returns
sp_returns.plot()

# summarize the daily returns
sp_returns.describe()
```

Output

```text
    count    251.000000
    mean       0.000458
    std        0.008205
    min       -0.035920
    25%       -0.002949
    50%        0.000205
    75%        0.004497
    max        0.024760
    Name: S&P 500, dtype: float64
```

<div style={{ backgroundColor: 'white' }}>

    width={640}
    height={427}
  />
</div>

## Calculating Excess Returns for Amazon and Facebook vs. S&P 500

Next, we need to calculate the relative performance of stocks vs. the S&amp;P 500 benchmark. This
is calculated as the difference in returns between <code>stock_returns</code> and{' '}

<code>sp_returns</code> for each day.

```python
# calculate the difference in daily returns
excess_returns = stock_returns.sub(sp_returns, axis=0)

# plot the excess_returns
excess_returns.plot()

# summarize the excess_returns
excess_returns.describe()
```

|       | **Amazon** | **Facebook** |
| ----- | ---------- | ------------ |
| count | 251.000000 | 251.000000   |
| mean  | 0.000360   | 0.000168     |
| std   | 0.016126   | 0.015439     |
| min   | -0.100860  | -0.051958    |
| 25%   | -0.006229  | -0.005663    |
| 50%   | 0.000698   | -0.000454    |
| 75%   | 0.007351   | 0.005814     |
| max   | 0.100728   | 0.149686     |

<div style={{ backgroundColor: 'white' }}>
  >
  <Image
    alt="output_13_1.png"
    src="/static/images/sharpe-ratio/output_13_1.png"
    width={640}
    height={427}
  />
</div>

## The Sharpe Ratio

### Step 1: The Average Difference in Daily Returns Stocks vs S&P 500

Now we can finally start computing the Sharpe Ratio. First we need to calculate the average of the{' '}

<code>excess_returns</code>. This tells us how much more or less the investment yields per day
compared to the benchmark.

```python
# calculate the mean of excess_returns
avg_excess_return = excess_returns.mean()

# plot avg_excess_returns
avg_excess_return.plot.bar(title='Mean of the Return Difference')
```

<div style={{ backgroundColor: 'white' }}>
  >
  <Image
    alt="output_15_1.png"
    src="/static/images/sharpe-ratio/output_15_1.png"
    width={640}
    height={427}
  />
</div>

### Step 2: Standard Deviation of the Return Difference

It looks like there was quite a bit of a difference between average daily returns for Amazon and
Facebook.

Next, we calculate the standard deviation of the <code>excess_returns</code>. This shows us the
amount of risk an investment in the stocks implies as compared to an investment in the S&amp;P 500.

```python
# calculate the standard deviations
sd_excess_return = excess_returns.std()

# plot the standard deviations
sd_excess_return.plot.bar(title='Standard Deviation of the Return Difference')
```

<div style={{ backgroundColor: 'white' }}>
  >
  <Image
    alt="output_17_1.png"
    src="/static/images/sharpe-ratio/output_17_1.png"
    width={640}
    height={427}
  />
</div>

## Putting it all together

Now we just need to compute the ratio of <code>avg_excess_returns</code> and{' '}

<code>sd_excess_returns</code>. The result is now finally the <em>Sharpe ratio</em> and indicates
how much more (or less) return the investment opportunity under consideration yields per unit of
risk.

The Sharpe Ratio is often <em>annualized</em> by multiplying it by the square root of the number
of periods. We have used daily data as input, so we'll use the square root of the number of
trading days (5 days, 52 weeks, minus a few holidays): √252

```python
# calculate the daily sharpe ratio
daily_sharpe_ratio = avg_excess_return.div(sd_excess_return)

# annualize the sharpe ratio
annual_factor = np.sqrt(252)
annual_sharpe_ratio = daily_sharpe_ratio.mul(annual_factor)

# plot the annualized sharpe ratio
annual_sharpe_ratio.plot.bar(title='Annualized Sharpe Ratio: Stocks vs S&P500')
```

<div style={{ backgroundColor: 'white' }}>
  >
  <Image
    alt="output_19_1.png"
    src="/static/images/sharpe-ratio/output_19_1.png"
    width={640}
    height={427}
  />
</div>

## Conclusion

Given the two Sharpe ratios, which investment should we go for? In 2016, Amazon had a Sharpe ratio
twice as high as Facebook. This means that an investment in Amazon returned twice as much compared
to the S&amp;P 500 for each unit of risk an investor would have assumed. In other words, in
risk-adjusted terms, the investment in Amazon would have been more attractive.

This difference was mostly driven by differences in return rather than risk between Amazon and
Facebook. The risk of choosing Amazon over FB (as measured by the standard deviation) was only
slightly higher so that the higher Sharpe ratio for Amazon ends up higher mainly due to the higher
average daily returns for Amazon.{' '}

When faced with investment alternatives that offer both different returns and risks, the Sharpe
Ratio helps to make a decision by adjusting the returns by the differences in risk and allows an
investor to compare investment opportunities on equal terms, that is, on an 'apples-to-apples'
basis.

```python
# Uncomment your choice.
buy_amazon = True
# buy_facebook = True
```
