Hi, my name is Ryan Toler, and I'm a Staff Sofware Engineer at GE Aviation in Cincinnati, Ohio. I graduated from the Georgia Institue of Technology in 2019 with my Master's in Computer Science. I specialize in using serverless technologies to build scalable and performant solutions.

Outside of my day job, I am also an Instructional Associate at the Georgia Institute
of Technology in the Computer Science Department. I currently help run one of the
largest online classes in the world, CSE 6242 - Data and Visual Analytics, which averages just under 1,000 graduate students a semester. I also assist with CS 7646 - Machine Learning for Trading to scratch my itch for stock trading.

In my free time, I enjoy working out, playing golf, trading stock options (my favorite ticker to trade is $TSLA), and staying up to date on the latest trends in computer science.
