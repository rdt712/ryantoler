[//]: # "Hello! I see you found my corner of the internet. My name is Ryan Toler and I am currently a Cloud Architect at Trek10. I previously work at GE Aviation in Cincinnati, Ohio. I graduated from the Georgia Institue of Technology in 2019 with my Master's in Computer Science. I specialize in building Serverless applications on AWS. Outside of my day job, I am also an Instructional Associate at the Georgia Institute of Technology in the Computer Science Department. I currently help run one of the largest online classes in the world, CSE 6242 - Data and Visual Analytics, which averages just under 1,000 graduate students a semester. In my free time, I enjoy working out, playing golf,"
