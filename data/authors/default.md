Ryan started his career at GE Aviation in their Digital Technology Leadership Program. Throughout the two year, six month rotational program, Ryan gained broad exposure to infrastructure, software engineering, data engineering, and technical product management. He then spent the next four years at GE Aviation as a software engineer and cloud architect leading the adoption and implementation of serverless technologies on AWS before coming to Trek10 as a Cloud Architect.

Ryan holds a bachelors degree in Computer Science from Northern Kentucky University and a masters degree in Computer Science from the Georgia Institute of Technology. On the side, he is also an Instructional Associate at Georgia Tech for the Data and Visual Analytics and Machine Learning for Trading courses in the Online Masters of Computer Science program.

Outside of work, Ryan is a sports fan and avid golfer, and you can find him obnoxiously cheering for the Cincinnati Bengals, or duffing a chip shot at his local golf course. Being from Kentucky, he often enjoys a glass bourbon from his ever growing collection.
